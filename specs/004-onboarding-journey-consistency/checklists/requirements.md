# Specification Quality Checklist: Onboarding Journey Consistency

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before implementation
**Created**: 2026-06-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] Acceptance criteria are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec 004 is a focused follow-up to spec 003 (marked COMPLETE) — it closes journey-specific gaps the user reported in onboarding, not a full-app re-audit.
- FR-4 allows Welcome titles to keep wizard typography if documented; implementer should pick one approach and update DEVDOC consistently.
- Spec 002 regression guard on Welcome pinned footer is explicit — any implementation must verify all three steps still pass viewport checks.
